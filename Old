The client sends request to server in the form of text messages whereas the server sends back the response for the request given by client.
Therefore, the exchange of request and response takes place in a single connection in HTTP.
HTTP can transfer data in various formats (plain text, hypertext, audio, video, etc.).
HTTP is Connectionless Protocol i.e. the client begins with request, waits for the response by the server and after that disconnects.
HTTP uses Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
